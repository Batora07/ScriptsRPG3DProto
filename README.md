# RPG Prototype Scripts

-- This is a page that allows me to save my scripts on a public repository to share them with ease, without making the main repo (and the sounds and 3D assets, that I do not own) public --

RPG Prototype made with the intent to have a sandbox playground to create gameplay elements made with Unity thanks to the courses and assets from Awesome Tuts (yt link : [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5c-DuzPdH9iaWYdI0v0uzw)  
Works with Unity 2019.1.0a12

Project made with Unity 2019.1.0a12.
The executable file link will be included in the final commit.

Here are a few examples of what I'm trying to achieve with this project :
