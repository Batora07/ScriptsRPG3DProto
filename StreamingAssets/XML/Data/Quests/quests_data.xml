      <questName>Find the tower entrance</questName>
      <quest_UnlockText>Hello Wanderer, the tower illuminated three days ago, I think that's why you came to out little town of Dorlice ? Maybe you could learn more about this tower if you get near the statues... They didn't reacted despite all of we did since 3 days. Maybe you'll be the chosen one and will be granted an access of some sort ? Heh, I know, why a wanderer like you would be of any use right ?</quest_UnlockText>
      <quest_CompleteText>I found the entrance of the Nexus. I should probably look around the place a bit</quest_CompleteText>
